# WindowsAzure Distribution Bundle

Stability: PRE-ALPHA, not production ready

Bundle provides tools to deploy a Symfony2 based application on Windows Azure. The idea is to plug this bundle into any existing Symfony2 application and get it running on Azure smoothly.

**Warning** This bundle is in very early development and will change. The functionality mentioned below is not fully implemented.
